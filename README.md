# Development Client

I am developing a client based on LiquidBounce.net, which features advanced functionality designed to prevent cheating. Currently, the client includes:

- **Velocity ​​for Polar**: causes your kb to be modified.
- **Antiban for AstralMC**: guarantees undetectability and safe play on AstralMC servers.
- **Reach for Grim**: Extends the attack range on Grim servers.
- **New rewind features and more**: Features innovative gameplay improvements and additional functionality.

I am dedicated to creating a solid client that combines advanced features with safe bypasses for different anti-cheat.
